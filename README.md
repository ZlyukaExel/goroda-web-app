Just an ordinary server-based PHP+HTML app to play goroda (cities)
You can easily change the list of cities and even make the game "words"
No bugs detected
The only problem - programm doesn't check if player has a city to answer, so the game basically stucks in that case
It can be easilly fixed, but i'm too lazy for it
Also refresh button could be added
